Imputing Data: Employee Salary 🧑‍💼💰
This project is part of the *"Master the Art of Data Analytics with Python (2025) course.
The aim is to handle missing values in an employee salary dataset and create a clean, reliable dataset for further data analysis.

## 📌 Project Objective
To clean the salary dataset and impute missing values using Python techniques such as mean, median, or mode imputation — preparing the data for real-world business insights and analysis.

## 🧠 Skills Applied
- Data Cleaning
- Missing Value Imputation
- Data Exploration
- CSV File Handling
- Pandas Library
- Google Colab

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Git & GitHub
  
## 📈 Workflow Overview

1. *Data Loading* – Import CSV file using Pandas.
2. *Data Exploration* – Analyze missing values and data structure.
3. *Imputation* – Fill missing salary data using:
   - Mean
   - Median
   - Mode
4. *Export* – Save cleaned dataset for further usage.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krishu321/Imputing-employee-salary.git
   cd Imputing-employee-salary

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

3. Execute cells in Copy_of_Untitled0.ipynb to view the entire data cleaning and imputation process.

📊 Outcome
A fully cleaned employee salary dataset (cleaned_employee_data.csv) that can be used in analytics dashboards or machine learning models.
